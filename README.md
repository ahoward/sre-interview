# Step One

* unpack the app (delivered to candidate as sre-interview.tgz)
* run it locally.  ok to help candidate if unfamiliar with node/npm

# Step Two

* write ./deploy.(sh|py|js|ts|whatever)
* pseudo code for various steps, eg, 'def push_to_cloud(directory)' is totally fine
* talk through platform, logging, exceptions, ci, env management

# Step Three

* support multiple envs.  aka, staging and production
